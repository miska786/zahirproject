            <p>My condition becoming very bad
            I knew that it was bad,still i could not give it up
and I started giving small hints at home, but all the people at home trusted me a lot. </p>
<p class="fourth-para">So they did not say anything to me and after some
time I went to the hostel,
<p>After coming to hostel,I did not do anything for 2 days and my condition became very bad.I was going and one day

            were very worried about me, my father used to scold me</p>
            <p>everyday that if i stay at home i will become more bad but how would they know that i am spoiled in the hostel,</p>
            <p>everything was available in the hostel like W/Y, NUMBER 4,GANJA,BROWN SUGAR,PUFF,ETC.</p>
